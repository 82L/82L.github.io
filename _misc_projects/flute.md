<p>This is a Taiwanese mini flute. It was used by aboriginal people to send messages across the mountains and valley of their island. The flute is only able to do a range.</p>

<p>There are around twenty aboriginal Taiwanese tribes recognised by the taiwanese government. Recently some historians started to research their ancestral instruments, prohibited during the Japanese occupation and the Chiang-Kai-shek dictatorship.</p>

<p>I was taught how to make this mini flute by an Amis person.</p>

<p>Like the picks, and the bamboomugs, I decorated some with pyrography.</p>

<p>Here is how it looks of a plain one : </p>
