<p>This project was made in a class to learn how to use Photoshop and Illustrator</p>
<p>I was tasked to do a game interface, and then do a mockup with it in a scene as a way to show our skills.</p>
<p>As I was already working for the Blake and Mortimer video game project, already did the graphic research on the comics serial, and needed a cover for it, the subject of the game interface was naturally chosen.</p>
<p>The design of the plane is completely taken from a comics drawing (credits to the rightful owners). I only added the planes in the background.</p>
<p>The scene of the mockup was given by the course teacher</p>
