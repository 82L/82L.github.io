<p>As I was travelling a lot for work, I tried to make my own portable screen to have a dual display everywhere I'd go.</p>
<p>The idea came from a Youtube video. I scavenged the screen from an old laptop, and used some reclaimed wood.</p>
<p>I took the screw inserts from the laptop frame to put them in the wood</p>
<p>The screen controller card was from amazon.</p>
<p>Sadly, even though the result is good-looking, there is a problem with the screen controller. The screen was unusable as it kept flickering</p>
