<p>That is one of my first game realisation.</p>
<p>We where tasked to do a casual game, using the library PhaserJS</p>
<p>I took some time to think of a more or less original game design. I didn't want to just copy a game design. The music is graciously lent by <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVpEvxxlkiVtnDQ9RjXGBEQ" target="_blank" >Prolofique</a>.</p>
