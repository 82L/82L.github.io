<p>This project is here because it is my first work in 3D!</p>
<p>I was given the 3D file of the cathedral, and tasked us to animate it by adding a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fps Controls</li>
<li>Lights</li>
<li>Points of interest, who opens a popup when you get near them</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these addons where to be made in solo, without any help or roadmaps. I'm quite proud of the implementation of the head movements with the camera, and of the fps control, which where made by using trigonometry</p>
