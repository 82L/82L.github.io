In this game, you play as a team ready to tackle a tournament of monstrous american football.

The game was heavily inspired from BloodBowl and Eyeshield 21.

The team size was variable throughout development. 

In the prototype/demo of this game I worked for a lot of different part:
- Gameplay: Characters skills, movement, internal logic.
- Cameras: Zooms, movement.
- UI: Menus, Skills selection

I worked both using the blueprint system and C++ classes. It was my first work with Unreal Engine, and it was a great experience.
