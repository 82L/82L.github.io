<p>The goal of this assignment was to make an interactive software using Animate, with a proposition in the software to make it more than just "fun"</p>
<p>I decided to bring alive the Edgar P. Jacobs albums of Blake and Mortimer. Motivated by seeing the game in a "promotional" aspect.</p>
<p>By following the story of the first three albums, I found enough material to do an adventure shoot'em up.</p>
<p>My ambition was a bit too big for the given deadline, so I narrowed down the scope, by transforming the adventure shoot'em up idea, to an endless one. With enemies going by waves, with one single type of enemy plane.</p>
<p>There was a lot of material to exploit, and I'm kind of sad to not have been able to use it.</p>
<p>Animate is one of the worst software when your goal is to develop a Video Game. I gave up the loop optimization to run this software smoothly.</p>
