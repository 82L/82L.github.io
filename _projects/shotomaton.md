This project was made by a team of 4 developers, as a way to promote our school during events using a simple and affordable game giving a souvenir.

The controls of the game are the players facial expressions. They are read by the game through a webcam and trained Neural Network.

The game is 2 player pvp only. Each player faces it's opponent, and their face must remain neutral while waiting for a prompt asking an expression. The quickest to do it win the round!

The first to win 3 rounds wins the game!

After the game is finished, the players are tasked to do a victory or a defeat pose.

On the event version, the pictures taken during the game are send to the mail of the player.

On the standalone version, the user is just redirected to the save folder.


This project was made on a class about project management. We spent more time establishing the project, evaluating the risks and other things.
In fact, due to deadlines, we cut a lot of feature in the project, as it was first envisioned as a warioware-like with a lot of mini-games.

Special thanks to Keijiro Takahashi and its amazing work on NN and unity integration, and to Maiwenn Lefloch, who made the game poster.
