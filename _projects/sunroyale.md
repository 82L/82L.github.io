<p>I worked in this project as a developer, when it was in 2D. My work was focused on game, menu UI, and debug. A lot of it was scraped for the 3D version.</p>
<p>Some of my work is still visible in the menus, and the animation of the victory screen. It was my first professional project on Unity, where I did learn a few things on Unity, DoTween and shaders.</p>
