This project was made in 4 days as part of a course on VR and the Unreal Engine.

We came up with the idea of doing a bowling game based on the physical motor of the game engine as a way to achieve our goal and to give us a field to experiment.

The scope was flexible, that's why we chose this type of game. If we had time, we could add more polish, more balls mechanics etc.

My role there was to make the bowling balls logic.

I first did a simple bowling ball, and I created child class to add the different actions:
- an explosive ball
- a black hole ball
- a rocket ball
- a zigzag ball

I also did the ball spawner, and corrected the game logic to make sure the pins where reset every 2 throws.

We're quite proud of what we've done because :
- The game is running smoothly on Meta Quest 2 headsets.
- The deadline was extremely short.
- Some members of the team didn't have any experience with the engine.
