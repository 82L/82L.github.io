<p>I worked on this project as a developer. I worked on the CMS managing the data and the Front End. </p>
<p>This isn't a very fun game, but I wasn't involved in the design.</p>
<p>The admin, via the CMS, can create multiple Meli-melo, with custom data and colors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He can choose how must fresco there is, with how much images composing it</p>
<p>The tricky part in this project was to make the design responsive, as the interface is "non-standard", with a lot of different shapes. </p>
<p>I'm quite proud of the animation on the game screen, as it is purely made of css.</p>
