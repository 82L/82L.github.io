I'm developing this portfolio since 2021. Originally from a Jekyll Timeline theme, I totally reworked it. 

I added some functionnalities, worked on the polymorphism of it. Added back posts, Photoswipe, bootstrap (for the responsive), and plenty of other things.

For the design, I tried a lot of things. Iterating away on css. It is always a complicate thing for me to do as a dev. 
And everytime I have to write a post, I rework the design or the architecture.

The modifications from 2024 being ones of the biggest, as I'm trying to promote it to a template, so other devs can use it, especially students.

If you find things that can be improved, don't hesitate to send an issue through GitHub!
