<p>This application is an audio-guide. It is the first app I developed for Opixido, in 2021. But due to delays with the client, it was only published on september 2022</p>
<p>The goal of the app is to give information about the museum to the user. The audio are narration driven, with comedians playing the role of the first owner of the auberge, and of the architect.</p>
<p>The application is in HTML5, packed for android with Capacitor.</p>
<p>The main libraries are Leaflet, Mediaelement and swiper.</p>
<p>The base of the application is the boilerplate used by Opixido in lots of projects.</p>
